# node-container

A simple nodejs server running inside a docker container.


## Getting started

Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

Open the terminal and run in this directory the following command:
```
  docker-compose up
```

The application will be available on the port 3000.

If everythings works correctly, you should see the message 'Hi Docker' on the screen.
